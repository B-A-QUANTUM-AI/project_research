Idea 1: Retail Inventory Management
 -AI system that predicts future product demand for a retail store based on historical sales, seasonal trends and events.
 Idea 2: Maintenance & Fault Detection for Manufacturing Machines
   -AI that analyzes data from manufacturing machines e.g vibration data, temperature, sound patterns to predict failures before they happen
 Idea 3: Brain Tumor Detection & Classification
   -The AI will first analyse the MRI scan to classify whether itâ€™s healthy or has a tumor using  classification. If a tumor is detected, it will analyse the scan again and classify the tumor type.
